# Advent of Code

The **Advent of Code** is a small yearly challenge where you are tasked to freely solve one programming puzzle for each day of the December calendar.

Here is the collection of all my solutions for each of the daily problems, which are contained in folders for the respective year.

The selected programming language is C++, but I could prefer to use a different one any time. I don't offer any explanation nor build instructions for the code, since I only use this repository as personal practice.
